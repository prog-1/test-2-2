# Mid-term test 2 (variant 2)

Fork the repository, add/edit files in the directories in order to complete the
test. The completed test must be submitted as a GitHub pull request to
[prog-1/test-2-2](github.com/prog-1/test-2-2) repository.

The test consists of four tasks (see below).

## 1. Code comprehension

Explain `erlaeuterung` program and complete the tasks. You may execute and modify the program.

The program contains special comments:

- `QUESTION N:` requires an answer provided in the following line prefixed with
  `ANSWER N:`. E.g.

   ```go
   // QUESTION 1: What is []int?
   // ANSWER 1: Creates a variable named `x` of type slice of ints.
   var x []int
   ```

- `TASK N:` requires an action described. In the following example we expect you
   to rename `f1` into something like `printSlice` - a function which has a
   better name:

   ```go
   // TASK 1: Provide a better name for the function.
   func f1(s [][]int) {
      for _, row := range s {
         for _, v := range row {
            fmt.Printf("%3d", v)
         }
         fmt.Println()
      }
   }
   ```

## 2. Progression (coding task)

Write a program that finds the `n`th term (`n` is a non-negative integer) of
the progression

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\begin{cases}a_0 = 1\\a_1 = 2\\a_i = 4a_{i-2} %2b a_{i-1}\end{cases}">
   
1. Create the program in the directory `progression`.
1. Implement the logic in a function declared as `func nthTerm(n uint) int`.
1. Implement `main()` function that
   1. reads `n` from the keyboard
   1. calls `nthTerm` function
   1. prints a value returned from the function.
1. Create a file with tests for the program. The tests must cover all
   representative inputs.
   
### Example 1
   
```
Enter n: 1
The nth term is 2.
```
   
**Explanation**:

`nthTerm(1)` must return `2`, because <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a_1 = 2">.
 
### Example 2
 
```
Enter n: 4
The nth term is 38.
```
    
`nthTerm(4)` must return `38`, because
    
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\begin{align*}a_0 %26= 1\\a_1 %26= 2\\ a_2 %26 = 4a_0 %2b a_1 = 4 \cdot 1 %2b 2 = 6\\a_3 %26 = 4a_1 %2b a_2 = 4 \cdot 2 %2b 6 = 14\\a_4 %26 = 4a_2 %2b a_3 = 4 \cdot 6 %2b 14 = 38\end{align*}">

## 3. Filter (coding task)

Write a program that removes all integers divisible by `5` from a slice of
integers.

1. Write the program in the directory `filter`.
1. Implement the logic in a function declared as `func filter(s []int) []int`.
1. Implement `main()` function that
   1. reads a slice from the keyboard (a user provides the number of elements
      in a slice and the element values)
   1. calls `filter` function
   1. prints the filtered slice.
1. Create a file with tests for the program. The tests must cover all
   representative inputs.

### Example 1

```
Enter the number of elements in a slice: 5
Enter the elements: 10 -15
The filtered slice: []
```

`filter([]int{-10, -15})` returns `[]int{}`, because all integer in the slice
are divisible by `5`, and are removed from the slice.

### Example 2

```
Enter the number of elements in a slice: 5
Enter the elements: -1 0 -5 15 4
The filtered slice: [-1 4]
```

`filter([]int{-1, 0, -3, 9, 4})` returns `[]int{-1, 4}`. `0`, `-5` and `15` are
integers divisible by `5` and are removed from the slice.

## 4. Generation (coding task)

Write a program that generates a matrix of values such as:

- the last row is filled with 0 except for the last element, which is 1;
- any other element of the table is the sum of all elements below it (in the
  same column) and to the right (in the same row).
  
1. Write the program in the directory `matrix`.
2. Implement the logic in a function declared as `func gen(width, height int) [][]int`.
3. Implement `main()` function that reads `width` and `height` from the keyboard
   and prints the generated matrix.
4. Create a file with tests for the program. The tests must cover all representative
   inputs.

### Example

```
Enter width and height: 5 4
Result:
 130  53  21   8   4
  36  16   7   3   2
   8   4   2   1   1
   0   0   0   0   1
```
